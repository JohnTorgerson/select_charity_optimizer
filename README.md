### Observations:
* The bulk of the work that goes into a machine learning project is in the preprocessing.
* Once the data is cleaned, the computer does most of the work to deliver the results we're seeking.
* That being said, there is still a lot to learn and understand about how, when, and which machine learning tools should be implemented.
* The comprehension mastery of what is going on behind the scenes could take a person years to learn and practice.
