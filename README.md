### Observations:
* < List Observations Here >
* The relationship is inverse.
* Engineer, Asst Engineer, Senior Engineer have similar AVG Salaries, with Senior Engineers making the least of the group. Meanwhile Senior Staff as well as general Staff, both AVG nearly 12,000 more. Also, from our previous examples, there are an awful lot of women named Hercules B____, which seems improbable.
* Either something is wrong, or this company data is fictional.
